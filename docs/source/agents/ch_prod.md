# Production Challenges and Best Practices

##
###

Deploying AI agents in real-world production environments comes with a host of practical challenges. We’ve touched on many throughout this guide – from technical issues like latency and cost to ethical and security concerns. In this final section, we’ll summarize some of the overarching best practices and common pitfalls to be aware of, framing a kind of checklist for successful AgentOps in production.


#### Challenges and Best Practices

- Challenge: Unpredictability and Nondeterminism – Unlike traditional software, the output of an AI agent (especially generative) is not fully deterministic. This can make debugging and consistency hard. Best Practice: Introduce as much determinism as feasible in critical paths. For instance, set random seeds or use deterministic decoding for tasks where consistency is more important than creativity. Log inputs and outputs meticulously (observability again) so you can retrospectively analyze any surprising behavior. Use test suites of example queries to sanity-check each new version of the agent (even if outputs aren’t identical due to nondeterminism, you can ensure they are within acceptable bounds or manually reviewed for key cases).

- Challenge: Evaluation of Agents – How do you know your agent is performing well and improving? Traditional metrics (accuracy, F1, etc.) may not capture an agent’s performance fully, especially if it’s doing complex interactive tasks.
Best Practice: Use a mix of evaluation methods: - Automated tests: for narrowly defined subtasks or known Q&A pairs. - User feedback: track ratings, task completion rates, or business KPIs (e.g., average handle time, resolution rate if it’s support). - Periodic human eval: sample outputs or sessions and have humans score them on quality, correctness, adherence to policy. - Establish a baseline and measure improvement with each agent update. Also measure failure modes – e.g., how often did it need human handover, how often it gave a wrong answer, etc. Aim to reduce those over time.

-Challenge: Drift and Model Updates – Over time, the base LLM might update (if using an API) or drift in behavior. Also, your knowledge base might get outdated.
Best Practice: Have a plan for continuous improvement. This includes updating the agent’s knowledge (feeding it new data or re-indexing documents regularly), and possibly fine-tuning or switching to improved model versions when available. However, treat model updates carefully – test them thoroughly because a new model might have different quirks. Maintain versioning: be able to roll back to a previous model/prompt if an update causes unforeseen issues. Monitor drift in metrics – if you see a degradation not tied to a deployment (maybe the external model changed behind the scenes), investigate and adjust.

- Challenge: Multi-Modality and Domain Specificity – Many agents will need to handle not just text, but maybe images (e.g., an agent analyzing a chart) or domain-specific jargon.
Best Practice: If needed, incorporate specialized models or tools for those modalities (e.g., an OCR tool for images, a domain-specific parser, etc.). Don’t try to force a single LLM to do something it’s not good at if a simpler tool can augment it. For domain-heavy content, consider fine-tuning the model on domain data or providing more extensive context from domain knowledge. Also, ensure domain experts are involved in validating the agent’s knowledge and responses for that field (like a medical expert reviewing a medical agent’s outputs).

- Challenge: User Trust and Adoption – Having a technically sound agent is one thing, but will users (or employees) actually use and trust it? People may be skeptical or may misuse it.
Best Practice: User experience design for the agent is crucial. Provide clear instructions on how to use it, maybe offer examples. Manage expectations by clearly stating what it can and can’t do. Solicit feedback actively (like after an interaction, “Did this answer your question?”). Perhaps include a “fallback to human” button always visible so users feel safe that they can get a real person if needed. Building trust takes time – start with agents as assistive (co-pilot style) and gradually automate more as trust grows. Internally, do training or demos for staff on how the agent works so they understand its value and limitations.

- Challenge: Organizational Buy-In and Governance – Adopting AI agents can raise concerns (job impact, compliance concerns, etc.).
Best Practice: Form an internal governance group or at least guidelines for AI agent use. This involves stakeholders from IT, security, legal, and the business. Define policies: e.g., what data can be used to train the agent? How do we handle mistakes? How do we communicate AI decisions (especially if they affect customers)? Consider a phased rollout – maybe internal use first, then limited external beta, then full launch – to gather support and refine. Having C-level endorsement helps, but also address employee concerns (position the agent as augmenting them, not replacing without support, etc.). On compliance: document what you’re doing to ensure fairness, privacy, etc., so if auditors or regulators ask, you have answers.


- Challenge: Maintenance and Support – Once deployed, who “owns” the agent’s performance? It’s not a one-and-done project; it requires ongoing monitoring and updates.
Best Practice: Assign clear ownership – maybe a product manager or an “AI lead” who continuously monitors metrics and user feedback, and coordinates improvements. Treat the agent as a product that has a lifecycle. Continuously curate its knowledge (for example, if a new product is launched, update the agent’s knowledge base; if company policy changes, ensure the agent’s responses reflect that). Plan periodic retraining or prompt tuning sessions as needed. Also plan for what happens if something goes really wrong (incident response). If the agent gives a really bad output that causes a PR issue, have a plan for communication and fixing the issue promptly.


- Challenge: Complex Failure Modes – Agents can fail in weird ways – e.g., getting stuck in loops, outputting in the wrong language, etc.
Best Practice: Along with monitoring, implement some self-correcting mechanisms. For instance, if the agent loops 3 times without progress, have it break and apologize (rather than keep going indefinitely). Or if it detects it is not being helpful, escalate. Ideally, the agent could have a “reflection” step (some research suggests allowing the model to self-reflect can catch mistakes). But simpler: set sane limits for loops, steps, etc., as discussed. Over time, analyze failure transcripts to categorize them: e.g., “answered incorrectly”, “didn’t understand query”, “tool failed”, etc., and address each category systematically (maybe additional training data or new guardrails for each).

- Challenge: Inter-agent Interference – If you deploy multiple agents in an organization (say one for IT help, one for HR questions), users might go to the wrong one or they might conflict in knowledge.
Best Practice: Clearly delineate scopes of agents to users. Possibly integrate them into one interface that can route queries to the right agent (like an AI assistant that knows which specialized agent to consult – a multi-agent orchestrator). Ensure they share consistent info on overlapping topics (e.g., both HR and IT agent might answer something about office hours – they should not disagree; maintain a single source of truth). Having a centralized knowledge repository that all agents use can help maintain consistency.

- Challenge: Ethics and Reputation – A high-profile mistake (like an agent giving offensive or wrong info) can damage trust.
Best Practice: Be proactive: test for biases, involve diverse stakeholders in evaluating outputs, and be transparent. If an error happens, address it openly: e.g., “We had an issue where the AI gave an incorrect answer about X; we have fixed it by Y and are sorry.” Often users are part of the process – show them you are actively improving based on their feedback. Maintain a human fallback especially early on so that mistakes can be caught before causing damage (like a human reviews communications before they go out if possible).

- Challenge: Integration with Existing Systems: Agents may need to fit into current workflows or software.
Best Practice: Use APIs and modular design so the agent can integrate via plugins or API calls into other platforms (like integrating a support agent into Zendesk or a Slack bot, etc.). This often means outputting responses in required formats or handling context passed from those systems. Plan integration testing with each system.


#### **Synthesizing Real-World Learnings**

* **Industry Implementations:** Examining the strategies of companies at the forefront of AI adoption reveals key patterns for success.  
  * **Airbnb:** The company's approach to agentic AI provides several critical lessons. They began with what they identified as their "hardest problem": customer service. This high-stakes use case forced them to confront issues of accuracy and hallucination risk head-on from the start. Their implementation is not a single model but a complex, custom agent built on 13 different models, which have been fine-tuned on tens of thousands of real customer conversations. This multi-model architecture highlights that a one-size-fits-all approach is insufficient for complex domains. The initial deployment has already reduced the need for human intervention by 15%, demonstrating tangible business value. Their ultimate goal is to transform their entire application into an "AI native" experience, with agents at its core.81 Furthermore, their experience in using LLMs for large-scale code migration reveals that success often requires a "sample, tune, sweep" strategy—an iterative, almost brute-force approach of retrying conversions with tweaked prompts until they succeed, rather than relying on complex prompt engineering alone.82  
  * **Netflix:** While Netflix has not publicly detailed specific "agent" systems in the same way as Airbnb, their mature and extensive use of machine learning for personalization, content recommendation, and creative analytics provides a blueprint for the data infrastructure and MLOps maturity required to support agentic AI at scale. Their internal application, Muse, which provides data-driven insights to creative teams, demonstrates a commitment to empowering human experts with AI-driven tools. Their pervasive use of A/B testing to validate every change offers a powerful model for how to rigorously evaluate an agent's impact on key business metrics, moving beyond technical performance to measure real-world value.83

#### **Common Pitfalls and Anti-Patterns**

Synthesizing the challenges discussed throughout this report reveals several common pitfalls that organizations must avoid when productionizing AI agents 11:

* **Technical Pitfalls:**  
  * Underestimating the complexity of integrating agents with legacy enterprise systems.  
  * Falling into the "new framework of the month" trap, leading to constant refactoring and a lack of a stable foundation.  
* **Quality Pitfalls:**  
  * Failing to define clear quality metrics beyond simple accuracy.  
  * Deploying agents whose non-deterministic and unpredictable outputs are not acceptable for the business context.  
* **Risk & Governance Pitfalls:**  
  * Treating security and compliance as an afterthought, rather than a core design principle.  
  * Failing to keep pace with the rapidly evolving regulatory landscape for AI.  
* **Operational & Strategic Pitfalls:**  
  * Not investing in the specialized skills required for an "AgentOps" team, distinct from traditional IT or MLOps teams.  
  * Lacking a robust strategy for cost management, leading to unsustainable operational expenses.

#### **A Production Readiness Checklist for CTOs**

To translate these learnings into an actionable tool, the following checklist provides a framework for assessing the maturity and risk of any agentic project before it is deployed into production.

**Table 3: The AgentOps Production Readiness Checklist**

| Category | Checklist Item | Status (Y/N) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Architecture & Design** | Is the reasoning paradigm (ReAct, ReWOO, etc.) appropriate for the task's complexity and performance requirements? |  |
|  | Is the memory architecture designed for efficient and relevant information retrieval? |  |
|  | Are all tools atomic, well-described, and following the principle of least privilege? |  |
|  | Is the agent's persona, goal, and instructions clearly and unambiguously defined in the prompt? |  |
| **Observability** | Is end-to-end tracing implemented for every agent task? |  |
|  | Are key metrics (cost, latency, error rates) being continuously monitored? |  |
|  | Is there a system for collecting and analyzing agent logs and events? |  |
|  | Is there a mechanism for tracking response quality and detecting model drift? |  |
| **Security** | Are all agent identities managed with secure M2M authentication? |  |
|  | Are all tool calls and data access points governed by granular, context-aware authorization? |  |
|  | Are user inputs sanitized to prevent prompt injection attacks? |  |
|  | Is high-risk code execution (e.g., Python interpreter) properly sandboxed? |  |
| **Governance & Trust** | Are input/output guardrails in place to enforce ethical and safety policies? |  |
|  | Has the system been audited for potential biases? |  |
|  | Is there a clear human-in-the-loop escalation path for failures or low-confidence situations? |  |
|  | Can an agent's decision-making process be audited and explained via its traces? |  |
| **Performance & Operations** | Has the agent been optimized for latency to meet user experience requirements? |  |
|  | Is token usage and overall cost being monitored and managed against a budget? |  |
|  | Is the deployment architecture designed for scalability and resilience (e.g., stateless services, auto-scaling)? |  |
|  | Is there a CI/CD pipeline for the automated testing and deployment of agent updates? |  |



#### Conclusion

Finally, one key best practice is starting small and iterating. Don’t launch a massively complex agent overnight. Start with a focused use case, get it right, build monitoring and trust, then expand scope or scale. The Medium guide suggested: Start small (instrument a single agent first, iterate thresholds), automate alerts, collaborate across teams, continuous testing, review budgets often, and document incidents for learning. Those are wise pieces of advice.


In essence, treat AgentOps as a continuous loop of design -> deploy -> monitor -> learn -> refine, much like DevOps but with the twist that the “software” (the AI) might evolve in non-code ways (prompt tweaks, model changes, training data updates). Embrace experimentation but under controlled, monitored conditions. And always keep the end goal in focus: delivering value (be it better customer service, faster decisions, etc.) safely and efficiently.


By adhering to these best practices and remaining vigilant to the challenges, you set your organization up to harness the power of AI agents while minimizing risks. As Gartner notably pointed out, agentic AI is a top strategic trend – but it requires preparation for both opportunities and risks. With a clear framework and careful operations (AgentOps), you can navigate this exciting frontier successfully.
