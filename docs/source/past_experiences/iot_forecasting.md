# Energy Demand Forecasting in Time Series IoT Data

##

---

### TL;DR: ML-Powered Energy Demand Forecasting for Smart Buildings

*   **Challenge:** The company needed to forecast building-level energy demand 24-72 hours in advance to provide valuable data to energy suppliers for grid balancing and to enable a new resident-facing feature for optimizing solar energy self-consumption. The system had to be accurate, reliable, and capable of handling complex factors like weather and holidays.

*   **My Role & Solution:** I led the development and operationalization of the forecasting system, serving as the Data Scientist and MLOps Engineer. My key contributions were:
    *   **Strategic Approach:** I designed a model development strategy that began with strong baselines (like SARIMAX and Prophet) and iteratively progressed to a high-performance XGBoost model. I established that forecasting at the building-level was the most effective initial approach, balancing accuracy with computational feasibility.
    *   **Feature Engineering:** I engineered a rich feature set crucial for forecast accuracy. This involved creating time-series features (lags, rolling windows), incorporating calendar events (holidays), and building a robust pipeline to process and align *future* weather forecast data with historical consumption patterns.
    *   **MLOps Infrastructure:** Using Terraform, I built a fully automated, serverless MLOps pipeline on AWS. The architecture included a distinct training workflow orchestrated by Step Functions for monthly model retraining, and a separate daily inference workflow that generates and stores forecasts.
    *   **Production Lifecycle Management:** I implemented the end-to-end system, including a containerized (Docker/ECR) forecasting model, versioning and governance via SageMaker Model Registry, and a CI/CD pipeline in Bitbucket for automated testing and deployment. The solution included a scalable serving layer using Amazon Timestream, API Gateway, and Lambda to deliver forecasts to both B2B and B2C consumers.

*   **Impact:** The forecasting system became a key data product for the company, unlocking new value for both business partners and residents.
    *   Achieved a **<10% Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** on 24-hour ahead building-level forecasts, providing reliable data to energy suppliers.
    *   Enabled the launch of the "Smart Energy Advisor" feature in the resident app, leading to a **15% increase in user engagement** with energy management tools. This, in turn, drove a measured ~10% increase in the building's solar self-consumption rate by empowering residents to align appliance usage with peak solar generation periods.

*   **System Architecture:** I designed and implemented the complete AWS solution, from data ingestion to API serving, ensuring scalability and automation.

### System Architecture
![](../_static/past_experiences/iot_forecasting/arch.png)

<!--
#### Data Characteristics

*   **Buildings:** 10 dozen = **120 buildings**.
*   **Apartments:** **3,000 apartments**.
*   **Sensors/Readings per Apartment:** ~8 (1 Energy, 1 Hot Water, 3 rooms * [1 Temp + 1 Setpoint]). Total sensors/readings ~24,000.
*   **Base Frequency:** Potential reading every 15 minutes.
*   **Storage Optimization:** Data is only recorded on change. We'll assume a **change rate of 10-20%** on average for sensor readings per interval, as temperatures, setpoints, and consumption are not constantly fluctuating dramatically. This is a crucial factor for volume estimation.
*   **Weather Data:** Fetched per building or per small geographical cluster of buildings.


| Data Type | Daily Volume (Average) | Data Velocity | Data Profile & Governance Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IoT Sensor Data (Time Series)** | **150 - 300 MB per day.** <br>This is the highest volume data. Calculated from ~3,000 apartments with ~8 readings each, potentially every 15 mins. Volume is significantly reduced by only storing changed values (assuming 10-20% avg change rate per interval). Spikes in volume can occur during coordinated events (e.g., building-wide heating adjustments, morning rush hour). | **Near Real-Time Events, Processed in Batch.** <br>Individual sensor readings are generated continuously, collected by in-apartment tablets, and sent periodically to the central database. Data is ingested into the analytical platform via **daily or hourly batch jobs** (e.g., using AWS Glue). | **Semi-Structured (JSON/DB Rows).** <br>Each record contains `apartment_id`, `building_id`, `timestamp`, `sensor_type` (e.g., `heating_energy_kwh`, `room_temp_c`, `setpoint_temp_c`, `hot_water_litres`), and `value`. <br>**Governance:** Data is linked to a specific apartment/building, making it sensitive. While not direct PII, it reveals resident behavior patterns. Governed by **FADP/GDPR**. Anonymization or pseudonymization is required for non-operational analysis. Data quality monitoring for sensor drift/failure is critical. |
| **Aggregated Consumption Data** | **< 10 MB per day.** <br>This data is derived from the raw IoT sensor data. Volume is low as it contains one aggregated record per building per hour. | **Batch-Generated.** <br>Created by a **daily AWS Glue ETL job** that processes the previous day's IoT sensor data. Not a direct stream from a source. | **Highly Structured (Parquet).** <br>Consists of a table with a well-defined schema: `building_id`, `timestamp_hour`, `total_consumption_kwh`, `total_solar_kwh`, etc. <br>**Governance:** Aggregation provides a layer of privacy compared to raw sensor data. Serves as the primary source of truth for building-level forecasting. Data lineage from raw sensor data must be maintained. |
| **External Weather Data** | **< 5 MB per day.** <br>Data is fetched for ~120 building locations (or geographical clusters). Volume depends on API response format and fetch frequency (hourly for history, more frequently for forecasts). | **Scheduled API Polling (Batch).** <br>Historical data is fetched via a **daily AWS Lambda job**. Future forecast data is fetched via a **Lambda job running several times a day** to ensure freshness. | **Semi-Structured (JSON from API).** <br>Contains `location` (lat/lon or city), `timestamp`, and various weather metrics (`temperature_c`, `humidity`, `cloud_cover`, `solar_irradiance_ghi_forecast`, etc.). <br>**Governance:** Dependent on a third-party provider (e.g., MeteoSwiss). Requires monitoring for API availability, changes, and rate limits. Caching strategies may be needed to manage costs and dependencies. |
| **Building & Apartment Topology** | **< 1 MB per day (on average).** <br>This is very low volume, consisting primarily of updates when new buildings/apartments are commissioned or structural changes are made. | **Low / On-Change.** <br>Synchronized via **daily or triggered batch jobs** from the main operational database or commissioning system. | **Highly Structured.** <br>Contains `building_id`, `apartment_id`, and potentially metadata like `building_size_sqm`, `num_rooms`, `building_age`, `insulation_type`. <br>**Governance:** The source of truth for the physical hierarchy. Data consistency is critical for correct aggregation and for potentially creating building "archetypes" for transfer learning (cold starts). |
| **System & User Feedback** | **< 1 MB per day.** <br>Generated when maintenance technicians label an anomaly alert (True/False Positive) or when residents report issues. | **Low / Event-Driven.** <br>Captured via the internal maintenance dashboard or resident support application. Ingested via API calls or **event-driven Lambda functions**. | **Highly Structured & High Value.** <br>Contains `alert_id`, `technician_id`, `feedback_label` (`True Positive`, `False Positive`, `Root Cause`), `timestamp`. <br>**Governance:** The primary source of labeled data for model evaluation and future supervised retraining. The quality and consistency of this feedback are critical for the ML lifecycle. |

#### Overall Data Flow

The EDF system utilizes distinct, automated pipelines for training forecasting models and generating daily forecasts. It relies on processed historical data and external weather forecasts. Forecasts are stored in a time-series database and made available via APIs.


1.  **Raw Data:** Aggregated Consumption, Solar Generation, Historical Weather, *Future Weather Forecasts*, Calendar/Topology data land in S3 Raw Zone.
2.  **Processed Data:** Ingestion pipeline processes *historical* data into `processed_edf_data` in S3 Processed Zone / Glue Catalog.
3.  **Features (Training):** Training Feature Engineering step reads `processed_edf_data`, calculates historical time-series features (lags, windows, time components), splits train/eval sets, and writes them to S3.
4.  **Features (Inference):** Inference Feature Engineering step reads recent `processed_edf_data` and *future raw weather forecasts*, calculates features for the forecast horizon using shared logic, and writes them to S3.
5.  **Model Artifacts:** Training jobs save serialized forecast models (Prophet JSON, XGBoost UBJ) to S3.
6.  **Evaluation Reports:** Evaluation jobs save forecast metrics (MAPE, RMSE) to S3.
7.  **Model Packages:** Approved forecast models are registered in the EDF Model Package Group.
8.  **Raw Forecasts:** Inference forecast generation step writes raw forecast outputs (timestamp, building, yhat, yhat_lower, yhat_upper) to S3.
9.  **Stored Forecasts:** Load Forecasts step reads raw forecasts from S3 and writes them into the target database (e.g., Timestream).
10. **Served Forecasts:** API Gateway and Lambda query the forecast database to serve B2B and B2C clients.





**Forecasting Pipeline Description:**

1.  **Ingestion:** Aggregated Consumption, Solar Generation, Topology/Calendar, and crucially, *Forecasted* Weather data are ingested into the Raw S3 Zone.
2.  **Processing:** A daily Glue ETL job aggregates data to the building level (if needed), joins it with weather forecasts and calendar info, and engineers features (lags, time features, weather interactions). Processed features are stored in S3 (and potentially SageMaker Feature Store for easier reuse/serving). The Glue Data Catalog is updated.
3.  **Model Training:** A Step Functions workflow orchestrates training, similar to AD, using appropriate forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet, Gradient Boosting, etc.). Models are registered.
4.  **Batch Inference:** A daily Step Functions workflow prepares features for the forecast horizon (using actual latest data *and future weather forecasts*), runs SageMaker Batch Transform, and stores the resulting forecasts (e.g., hourly demand for next 72h) in S3.
5.  **Results Storage:** Raw forecasts are stored in S3. A subsequent job loads the forecasts into a database optimized for time-series queries or fast lookups (DynamoDB, RDS, or potentially Amazon Timestream).
6.  **Serving:**
    *   **B2B:** A dedicated API Gateway endpoint uses Lambda to query the Forecast Database, perform necessary aggregation/anonymization, and return forecasts to authorized suppliers/DSOs.
    *   **B2C:** The existing App/Tablet backend queries the Forecast Database (likely via another API Gateway endpoint) to get simplified data for resident visualization (comparing building demand vs. solar).
    *   **Analysts:** Use Athena for ad-hoc analysis.

<!--

**Context:** The goal is to produce accurate, building-level, short-term (24-72h) energy demand forecasts. The model must leverage time-series patterns, holiday effects, and crucially, future weather forecasts. Success is measured by the accuracy of point forecasts.

**Evaluation Metric:**
*   **Primary Metric:** **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**. It's a standard, intuitive metric for forecasting that expresses error as a percentage of the actual value. A MAPE of 10% means the forecast is, on average, 10% off the actual value.
*   **Secondary Metric:** **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**. This metric is in the same units as the target (kWh) and penalizes large errors more heavily than MAPE, which is important for avoiding significant misses during peak consumption periods.

**Evaluation Method:**
All experiments are evaluated using a consistent backtesting methodology. The model is trained on a rolling window of historical data (e.g., 1 year) and then used to forecast the next period (e.g., 1 week). This process is repeated over multiple splits of the test set to get a robust estimate of out-of-sample performance.

---

Here is a list of the experiments performed:

| Experiment / Iteration | Model/Technique | Features Used | Evaluation Metric & Hypothetical Result | Key Learnings & Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1: Baselines & Classical Time Series Models** |
| **1. Baseline Model** | Seasonal Naive | - `consumption_kwh` (target) | **MAPE:** 28%<br>**RMSE:** 12.5 kWh | **Rationale:** Establish the absolute minimum performance benchmark. The model predicts the consumption from the same hour on the same day of the previous week. Its poor performance highlights the strong influence of factors other than simple weekly seasonality, especially weather. |
| **2. Classical Univariate Model** | SARIMA | - `consumption_kwh` (target) | **MAPE:** 21%<br>**RMSE:** 9.8 kWh<br>*(Improvement: ~25% vs. Baseline)* | **Rationale:** Test a standard statistical time-series model. `auto_arima` was used to find optimal `(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)` parameters. SARIMA successfully captured trend and autocorrelation, significantly outperforming the naive baseline. However, its errors clearly correlated with unexpected weather changes, proving the need for exogenous variables. |
| **3. Multivariate Statistical Model** | SARIMAX | - Target: `consumption_kwh`<br>- **Exogenous:** `temperature_c`, `is_holiday_flag` | **MAPE:** 16%<br>**RMSE:** 7.2 kWh<br>*(Improvement: ~24% vs. SARIMA)* | **Rationale:** Introduce external factors that are known in advance. Adding historical weather and holiday flags as exogenous variables provided a major boost in accuracy. This confirmed that weather is a primary driver of energy consumption. Parameter tuning remained complex. |
| **Phase 2: Modern & Machine Learning Models** |
| **4. Decomposable Model** | Prophet | - Target: `consumption_kwh`<br>- **Regressors:** `temperature_c`, `solar_irradiance_ghi`, `is_holiday_flag` | **MAPE:** 14%<br>**RMSE:** 6.5 kWh<br>*(Improvement: ~12.5% vs. SARIMAX)* | **Rationale:** Test a more modern, flexible time-series model. Prophet's ability to handle multiple seasonalities (daily, weekly) and its robust holiday modeling, combined with weather regressors, gave it an edge over SARIMAX. It was also significantly faster to train and easier to configure. |
| **5. ML Regression Model (Basic Features)** | XGBoost | - Target: `consumption_kwh`<br>- **Basic Time Features:** `hour_of_day`, `day_of_week`<br>- **Exogenous:** `temperature_c`, `solar_irradiance_ghi`, `is_holiday_flag` | **MAPE:** 13.5%<br>**RMSE:** 6.3 kWh<br>*(Improvement: ~3.5% vs. Prophet)* | **Rationale:** Treat forecasting as a standard regression problem. Even with basic time features, XGBoost's ability to capture non-linear relationships (e.g., the effect of temperature is not linear) allowed it to slightly outperform Prophet. This demonstrated the potential of tree-based models. |
| **6. ML Regression Model (Advanced Features)** | XGBoost | All previous features +<br>- **Lag features** (e.g., consumption 24h & 168h ago)<br>- **Rolling window features** (e.g., 24h avg consumption/temp)<br>- **Interaction features** (e.g., temp * hour) | **MAPE:** 9.5%<br>**RMSE:** 4.1 kWh<br>*(Improvement: ~30% vs. XGBoost Basic)* | **Rationale:** Provide the model with deep temporal context. This was the most significant leap in performance. Lag and rolling window features allowed the model to understand recent consumption patterns and trends, which are highly predictive. **This established XGBoost with rich features as the champion model.** |
| **7. Hyperparameter Optimization** | XGBoost (Tuned) | Same as Exp #6 | **MAPE:** 8.2%<br>**RMSE:** 3.6 kWh<br>*(Improvement: ~14% vs. XGBoost Advanced)* | **Rationale:** Fine-tune the champion model. Using SageMaker's Automatic Model Tuning to optimize XGBoost's key hyperparameters (`n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `learning_rate`, etc.) squeezed out a significant, final improvement in accuracy, bringing the model to production-ready performance. |
| **Phase 3: Deep Learning & Global Models** |
| **8. Global Model Exploration** | DeepAR | - **Target:** `consumption_kwh`<br>- **Covariates:** Weather forecasts, time features<br>- **Static Features:** `building_id` | **MAPE:** 8.5%<br>**RMSE:** 3.8 kWh | **Rationale:** Test if a global model trained across all buildings could outperform the building-specific XGBoost models. DeepAR performed very well, nearly matching the tuned XGBoost, and its key advantage was providing a probabilistic forecast (prediction intervals). However, its complexity and slightly lower point-forecast accuracy meant it did not replace XGBoost as the champion for this specific goal. It is retained as a strong candidate for future probabilistic forecasting features. |


### Model development Iteration: Takeaways

The model development for Energy Demand Forecasting followed a path of progressively adding complexity and context, leading to significant accuracy gains at each major step:

1.  **Exogenous Variables are Critical:** The first major improvement came from moving beyond purely univariate models (like SARIMA) to models that incorporate external drivers like weather and holidays (SARIMAX, Prophet, ML models).
2.  **ML Models Outperform Classical for Non-Linearity:** Machine learning models, particularly **XGBoost**, demonstrated an advantage over classical statistical models like SARIMAX by being able to capture complex, non-linear relationships between features (especially temperature) and energy consumption.
3.  **Advanced Feature Engineering is the Key Driver:** The most substantial performance gain was achieved by creating rich temporal features (lags and rolling windows). This highlights that for regression-based forecasting, feature engineering is often more important than the initial choice of algorithm.
4.  **A Tuned ML Model is the Champion:** A well-featured and hyperparameter-tuned **XGBoost** model provided the best point-forecast accuracy, balancing performance with reasonable training times and a well-understood implementation.
5.  **Deep Learning Shows Promise:** **DeepAR** proved to be a powerful alternative, especially for its ability to learn across buildings and provide probabilistic forecasts, marking it as a valuable tool for future enhancements rather than an immediate replacement for the champion model.

This highlights the importance of optimizing the database configuration (e.g., memory vs. magnetic retention) and query patterns for the serving APIs to manage costs effectively.


### Challenges and learnings

<!--

### Challenge 1: The "Sunny Winter Day" Problem - Model Inability to Generalize to Unseen Conditions

**Chronological Events:**

1.  **Initial Model Success (First 6 Months):** The team develops a champion XGBoost model (Exp #7) for forecasting building-level energy demand. It's trained on one full year of historical data and performs well in backtesting, achieving a respectable ~8% MAPE. The model's feature importance, analyzed with SHAP, shows that `temperature_c`, `hour_of_day`, and `consumption_lag_24h` are the dominant drivers, as expected. The model is deployed, and the daily inference pipeline begins providing forecasts to a pilot group of energy suppliers.

2.  **The First Catastrophic Failure (First Winter in Production):** In late November, a weather pattern emerges that was rare in the single year of training data: a week of unusually sunny but extremely cold days. The daily forecast accuracy plummets. The model consistently and significantly *under-predicts* energy demand for the entire week, with the MAPE spiking to over 30%.

3.  **High-Stakes Business Impact:** The pilot energy supplier is furious. Relying on the forecast, they procured insufficient energy on the spot market and had to buy expensive peak-load power to cover the shortfall, incurring significant financial losses. They threaten to pull out of the pilot. The internal product and marketing teams are under immense pressure to explain the failure.

4.  **Initial Debugging - No Obvious Errors:** The MLOps team investigates. The inference pipeline ran successfully with no errors. The input weather forecast data from the API was accurate—it correctly predicted sunny and cold conditions. The model health checks passed. Tracing the Step Function execution shows everything worked as designed. The problem wasn't a technical failure; it was a **model failure**.

5.  **Deep Dive with SHAP and Feature Analysis (Week 2 of Failure):** The ML team pulls the inference feature data and the model's predictions for the failure period. They run SHAP analysis on the specific predictions and discover the root cause:
    *   **Feature Interaction Problem:** In the training data, the feature `solar_irradiance_ghi` was highly correlated with `temperature_c` (sunny days were generally warm). The model learned a strong, simple interaction: `if solar_irradiance is HIGH -> then energy_demand is LOW` (because less heating is needed and residents might be out).
    *   **Failure to Generalize:** When faced with a new, unseen combination of `HIGH solar_irradiance` and `LOW temperature_c` (a sunny winter day), the model incorrectly gave too much weight to the `solar_irradiance` feature. It predicted low energy demand because it was sunny, failing to account for the overriding effect of the extreme cold. It had learned a correlation, not the true causal relationship.

6.  **Exploring Solutions (Week 3):** The team brainstorms how to fix this fundamental generalization issue:
    *   **Option A (More Data):** Wait several years to collect more examples of "sunny winter days". This is unacceptable from a business perspective.
    *   **Option B (Better Features):** Engineer features that are more robust to these interactions. The team experiments with creating interaction terms explicitly (e.g., `temperature * solar_irradiance`) and non-linear transformations of temperature (e.g., polynomial features) to help the model learn that the effect of temperature is not linear and dominates at cold extremes.
    *   **Option C (Different Model):** Re-evaluate models that might handle these relationships differently. Could a simpler model like Prophet (with seasonality and weather regressors) be less prone to this specific error? Could an LSTM capture the temporal context better?

7.  **Resolution: Hybrid Approach (Week 4-5):**
    *   **Feature Engineering (Primary Fix):** The team implements **Heating Degree Days (HDD)** as a new feature. HDD is a non-linear transformation of temperature specifically designed to measure heating requirements (`max(0, 18°C - outdoor_temp)`). This single feature is much more causally linked to heating demand than raw temperature.
    *   **Model Retraining:** They retrain the XGBoost model with the new HDD feature and other interaction terms. In offline testing on the problematic week, the new model's MAPE drops from 30% to ~12%, a massive improvement.
    *   **Monitoring Enhancement:** They add a new monitoring check to the inference pipeline: an "out-of-distribution" (OOD) alert. This check compares the joint distribution of key input features for the upcoming forecast (e.g., `temperature_c` vs. `solar_irradiance_ghi`) against the distributions seen in the training data. If a highly unusual combination is detected, it flags the forecast with a "low confidence" warning, even if the model produces a prediction. This manages stakeholder expectations.

**Lessons & Retrospective:**

*   **"What were the challenges?":** "Our biggest challenge was a catastrophic model failure in production due to the model's inability to generalize to weather conditions that were rare in our training data. The model learned a spurious correlation between sunshine and warmth, which led to significant under-prediction during a 'sunny but cold' week, causing direct financial impact for our partner. The incident was hard to debug because it wasn't a code error but a fundamental data science problem."
*   **"What would you change?":** "I would place a much stronger emphasis on **stress-testing the model against plausible but unseen feature combinations** during the evaluation phase, before ever deploying to production. Instead of just relying on a historical backtest split, we should have synthesized adversarial data points (like high sun/low temp, low sun/high temp) to check for logical consistency in the model's predictions. Furthermore, I would implement input data monitoring for out-of-distribution detection from day one."

### Challenge 2: The Holiday Effect Mismatch - Aligning Model Features with Business Reality

**Chronological Events:**

1.  **Initial Implementation:** The team uses a standard Python library to generate a list of Swiss national and cantonal holidays. This is added as a binary `is_holiday_flag` feature to the Prophet and XGBoost models.
2.  **Observed Errors:** During the first year of operation, the team notices recurring large forecast errors around specific holidays.
    *   **Christmas Week:** The model accurately predicts the dip on Christmas Day (Dec 25th) and the 26th, but it massively *over-predicts* demand for the 24th and the 27th-30th.
    *   **"Bridge" Days:** On days falling between a weekend and a public holiday (e.g., a Monday before a Tuesday holiday), the model predicts normal weekday consumption, but actual consumption is much lower.
    *   **School Holidays:** The model completely misses the sustained, slightly-higher-than-normal consumption patterns during regional school holiday weeks, which are not official public holidays.
3.  **Business Impact:** While not as catastrophic as the winter failure, these errors reduce trust with suppliers, who need to plan for multi-day events, not just single holidays. Internally, the "smart energy advice" feature gives poor recommendations to residents during these periods.
4.  **Problem Diagnosis:** The ML team realizes that a simple `is_holiday` flag is a naive representation of human behavior. The "holiday effect" is not a single-day event.
    *   For Christmas, the effect is a *period* of lower commercial/industrial demand but potentially different residential patterns, starting before the day itself and lasting until the New Year.
    *   "Bridge" days act like semi-holidays.
    *   School holidays change the daytime occupancy patterns of families.
5.  **Reframing the Feature:** The problem is reframed from "Is this day a holiday?" to "What *type* of day is this from a socio-economic behavior perspective?".
6.  **Solution: Advanced Calendar Features & Custom Holiday Modeling (Iteration):**
    *   **Data Enrichment:** The team works with the product manager to identify and source data for all major Swiss school holiday periods by canton.
    *   **Feature Engineering:** They replace the single `is_holiday_flag` with a richer set of features:
        *   `days_until_next_holiday`: A continuous feature counting down to the next major holiday.
        *   `days_since_last_holiday`: A continuous feature counting up from the last major holiday.
        *   `is_bridge_day`: A binary flag for "bridge" days.
        *   `is_school_holiday`: A binary flag.
        *   `holiday_name`: A categorical feature (e.g., 'Christmas', 'Easter', 'NationalDay').
    *   **Model-Specific Implementation:**
        *   **For Prophet:** They create a custom `holidays` dataframe that includes not just the holiday itself but also the surrounding days with different names (e.g., `Christmas_Eve`, `Christmas_Day`, `Boxing_Day`, `Christmas_Week`). Prophet can learn a separate effect for each of these "holidays".
        *   **For XGBoost:** They add the new engineered features (`days_until...`, `is_bridge_day`, etc.) directly to the feature set.
7.  **Results & Validation:** After retraining the models with these new, richer calendar features, the forecast accuracy around holiday periods improves dramatically. The MAPE for the Christmas week drops from over 25% to around 10%. The models now correctly anticipate the pre-holiday slowdown and the "bridge day" effect.

**Lessons & Retrospective:**

*   **"What were some of the challenges?":** "A key challenge was accurately modeling human behavior around holidays. Our initial approach of using a simple binary holiday flag was too simplistic and failed to capture the complex, multi-day nature of events like Christmas or the subtle effects of school holidays. This led to significant and predictable forecast errors, damaging stakeholder trust."
*   **"If you were to start over...":** "I would collaborate with a product manager or domain expert from the very beginning to build a 'behavioral calendar' instead of just using a standard holiday library. We should have brainstormed all the event types that affect energy consumption—public holidays, school holidays, bridge days, major local events—and designed features to capture them explicitly. It's a lesson in not just using off-the-shelf features but thinking deeply about how to translate real-world context into a format the model can understand."

### Challenge 3: The API Latency Crisis - Mismatch Between Batch Model & Real-Time Needs

**Chronological Events:**

1.  **Initial Design:** The inference pipeline is designed as a daily batch process. It runs overnight, generating a 72-hour forecast for all buildings, which is then loaded into an Amazon Timestream database. An API Gateway + Lambda is built to serve these stored forecasts to the B2C mobile app.
2.  **New Feature Request:** The Product team, excited by the forecasts, designs a new "real-time cost optimization" feature for the mobile app. The idea is that a user can see the building's current demand and the next few hours' forecast to decide whether to run their washing machine *now* or in an hour. This requires the API to be fast and reflect the latest data.
3.  **The Latency Problem:** When the feature is prototyped, the UX is poor. The API call to the Lambda function, which then queries Timestream, sometimes takes 2-3 seconds. The main issue is the query itself: to construct a user-friendly chart, the Lambda needs to pull 24-48 hourly data points for a specific building, which can be a moderately heavy query for Timestream when invoked frequently by thousands of users simultaneously.
4.  **Initial Solution - Caching:** The team's first reaction is to add a caching layer. They implement an ElastiCache (Redis) cluster in front of the Timestream database. The Lambda now first checks Redis for the forecast; if it's a miss, it queries Timestream and then populates the cache. This improves latency for repeated requests for the same building but introduces cache invalidation complexity and adds significant infrastructure cost (24/7 Redis cluster).
5.  **The "Stale Forecast" Problem:** A bigger issue arises. The batch forecast is generated only once per day (at 5 AM). If a major, un-forecasted weather event occurs at 2 PM (e.g., a sudden thunderstorm darkens the sky), the solar generation plummets and building consumption spikes. The forecast shown in the app is now completely wrong and won't be updated until the next day. Users complain that the "smart" feature is not very smart.
6.  **Re-evaluating the Architecture:** The team realizes they have an architectural mismatch. They have a **batch inference system** trying to serve a **near real-time use case**. The 24-hour cycle is too slow.
7.  **The Final Solution - A Hybrid "Serve & Refresh" Pattern:**
    *   **Keep the Batch System:** The daily, full 72-hour forecast generated by the complex XGBoost/Prophet model is still valuable for the B2B use case (suppliers) and for setting the daily baseline. It continues to load into Timestream.
    *   **Create a Lightweight "Refresher" Model:** The ML team develops a much simpler, faster model (e.g., a simple Linear Regression or a very lightweight Prophet model). Its only job is to provide a *short-term correction* to the main forecast based on the *most recent* (e.g., last 1-2 hours) consumption data and updated near-term weather forecasts.
    *   **New "Refresh" Pipeline:** They create a lightweight, serverless pipeline (e.g., an EventBridge rule triggering a Lambda function every 15-30 minutes). This Lambda:
        1.  Fetches the last hour of actual consumption.
        2.  Calculates the recent forecast error (Actual - Baseline Forecast).
        3.  Uses the simple "refresher" model to predict the next 1-3 hours' correction.
        4.  Writes this *updated* short-term forecast (Baseline + Correction) to a **different, low-latency storage: DynamoDB**, which is optimized for fast key-value lookups.
    *   **Update the API:** The B2C API Lambda is changed. It now queries DynamoDB first to get the latest, frequently refreshed forecast for the next few hours. For the longer-term forecast (e.g., hours 4-24), it falls back to querying Timestream (or the Redis cache).

8.  **Result:** The user-facing feature becomes much more responsive and accurate. API latency for the critical next-few-hours forecast drops to <100ms. The system can now react to intra-day deviations from the baseline forecast. This hybrid architecture successfully serves both the long-term B2B planning needs and the short-term B2C real-time needs without a complete, costly overhaul to a fully real-time inference system.

**Lessons & Retrospective:**

*   **"Production bugs that made you regret decisions?":** "My regret was not clarifying the specific latency and freshness requirements for *all* potential use cases at the beginning. We designed a perfect batch system, but the business wanted a real-time feature. This led to a series of costly patches (like adding ElastiCache) before we finally addressed the core architectural mismatch. We tried to solve a data freshness problem with a caching solution, which was the wrong approach."
*   **"What would you change?":** "I would have a dedicated discussion about the 'Time-to-Live' and 'Time-to-Action' for our forecasts. For the B2B use case, a 24-hour TTL is fine. For the B2C feature, the TTL was less than an hour. Recognizing this difference upfront would have led us to design the hybrid 'Serve & Refresh' architecture from the start, saving us the time and expense of the intermediate caching solution and avoiding stakeholder frustration."



### Deep Dive: The "New Commissioning" Cold Start Challenge

**The Core Problem:**

The most effective models developed (both for Anomaly Detection and Forecasting) are data-hungry. They rely on a sufficient history of consumption data for a specific building or apartment to learn its unique "normal" patterns, including its thermal response to weather, seasonal cycles, and typical resident behavior. A newly commissioned building has no such history. This creates a high-stakes paradox: the period when predictive monitoring is *most valuable* (identifying early-life failures, incorrect installations, or commissioning errors) is precisely when the primary data-driven models are at their *weakest*.

**Related Challenges Stemming from the Cold Start Problem:**

1.  **Inability to Establish a Baseline:**
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Models like LOF, Isolation Forest, and forecasting-based methods (Prophet, XGBoost) have no concept of a "normal" baseline for the new building. Any initial behavior could be misinterpreted. A low-consumption building might be flagged as anomalous when compared to the global average, even if its behavior is perfectly normal for its high-efficiency design.
    *   **Forecasting:** Models cannot learn the building's specific thermal inertia, response to solar gain, or the typical daily/weekly rhythm of its residents. Forecasts will be highly inaccurate.

2.  **High Rate of "False Alarms":**
    *   **Initial Occupancy Flux:** In the first few weeks or months, apartments are gradually occupied. The building's aggregate consumption pattern is unstable and constantly changing as more residents move in. A model trying to find a stable pattern will constantly be "surprised," leading to a storm of false positive anomalies.
    *   **System "Burn-in":** The heating and ventilation systems themselves might be undergoing initial calibration or "burn-in," exhibiting patterns that will not be present later in its operational life. An ML model will flag these transient but normal behaviors as anomalous.

3.  **Risk of Masking True Anomalies:**
    *   The high noise and instability of the initial data can mask a true, critical anomaly. If everything looks anomalous, then nothing stands out. A genuinely faulty valve causing a leak might be lost in the noise of alerts generated by residents moving in and adjusting their thermostats for the first time.

4.  **Ineffective Transfer of Global Knowledge:**
    *   As we saw in the "Multi-Building Dilemma" challenge, a single global model performs poorly on buildings that deviate from the average. Simply applying a global model to a new building is a recipe for failure, especially if the new building is of a different archetype (e.g., a new high-efficiency design).

---

### Potential Solutions: A Tiered, Multi-faceted Approach

A robust solution to the cold start problem is not a single model but a **graceful, evolving strategy** that provides the best possible insight at each stage of data availability.

**Tier 1: The Zero-Data & Commissioning Phase (First ~4 Weeks)**

At this stage, we have no historical consumption data. The focus is on physics-based and rule-based checks.

*   **Solution: Physics-Informed Heuristics & Commissioning Rules:**
    *   **How it Works:** Instead of relying on learned patterns, we use simple, engineering-driven rules based on the physical constraints of the system. This is a form of expert system.
    *   **Implementation:** A separate, simpler rules engine (which could be a Lambda function or a specific configuration for our existing models) would check for violations of "common sense" heating logic.
    *   **Example Rules for Anomaly Detection:**
        *   **"Stuck Valve" Rule:** If `heating_kwh > 0` for an apartment for `X` consecutive hours while `room_temp_c > setpoint_temp_c + 2°C`, flag a high-priority alert. This suggests the valve is stuck open.
        *   **"No Response" Rule:** If `setpoint_temp_c > room_temp_c + 2°C` and `heating_kwh > 0` for `Y` consecutive hours, but `room_temp_c` does not increase, flag an alert. This suggests a blockage or failure to deliver heat.
        *   **"Sensor Mismatch" Rule:** If `room_temp_c` for one apartment is drastically different (>5°C) from all its neighbors in the same building for a prolonged period, flag a potential sensor failure.
    *   **Forecasting:** No complex forecasting is possible. The "forecast" could simply be a static profile based on the building's design specifications, adjusted by the real-time weather forecast. This is more of a "plan" than a learned forecast.

**Tier 2: The Scant-Data Phase (Weeks 4 to ~6 Months) - Bayesian & Archetype Models**

We now have some data, but not enough for robust, individualized models. The goal is to combine this limited local data with knowledge from existing, similar buildings.

*   **Solution: Bayesian Priors & Transfer Learning from Archetypes:**
    *   **How it Works (Bayesian Intuition):** A Bayesian approach starts with a "prior belief" about how a system should behave and updates this belief as it sees new data. Our "prior belief" can be derived from data from older, similar buildings.
        *   **Anomaly Detection:** Instead of a simple regression (`Energy = B * HDD`), we use a Bayesian Linear Regression. The *prior* for the coefficient `B` (the building's sensitivity to weather) is not a single value but a *distribution* (e.g., a normal distribution) whose mean and variance are calculated from all existing "Modern High-Density" buildings. As we collect the first few weeks of data for the new building, the model updates this distribution to find a "posterior" `B` that is a sensible compromise between the archetype average and the new building's own (limited) data. An anomaly is a point that is unlikely given this posterior model.
        *   **Forecasting:** Similarly, a Bayesian forecasting model (like Prophet, which has a Bayesian backend) can be initialized with stronger priors for seasonality and trend parameters, where these priors are derived from the average parameters of the building's archetype.
    *   **How it Works (Simple Transfer Learning):**
        *   **Anomaly Detection/Forecasting:** Train a model (e.g., XGBoost) on all data from a specific building archetype (e.g., "High-Efficiency"). Use this pre-trained model to generate initial predictions for the new building. As more data comes in from the new building, this model can be fine-tuned using the new data, or we can slowly blend its predictions with a new model trained only on the new building's data.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Requires a robust system for **classifying buildings into archetypes** based on metadata (age, size, insulation, heating system type). This becomes a critical data governance task.
        *   The MLOps pipeline needs to be able to select these "archetype models" or "Bayesian priors" for any building that is less than `N` months old.

**Tier 3: The Mature Data Phase (6+ Months)**

The building now has sufficient historical data to stand on its own.

*   **Solution: Transition to Fully Individualized Models:**
    *   **How it Works:** The system automatically transitions from using the archetype/Bayesian model to a model trained specifically on that building's (or its apartments') own data.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   The model training pipeline (e.g., `ADTrainingWorkflow`) is triggered for this specific building once it crosses the data threshold (e.g., 6 months of data).
        *   The inference pipeline's model selection logic (`GetApprovedModelPackage` and the subsequent steps) is updated to now look for a dedicated model for this building. If one exists and is approved, it uses it; otherwise, it falls back to the Tier 2 archetype model.
        *   This creates a seamless handoff from the cold-start solution to the mature-phase solution.

**Summary of the Evolving Strategy:**

| Data Availability | Primary Approach | Models / Techniques | Key Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0-4 Weeks** | Physics-Informed Rules | Heuristics, simple thresholds, sensor cross-validation. | Well-defined engineering rules. |
| **1-6 Months** | Transfer Learning / Bayesian Priors | Archetype-based models (XGBoost, Prophet), Bayesian Regression with priors from archetypes. | Accurate building metadata and a robust archetype classification system. |
| **6+ Months** | Individualized Modeling | Fully trained models (XGBoost, Prophet, etc.) using only the building's/apartment's own historical data. | Automated trigger to graduate a building from the cold-start strategy to the mature strategy. |

This tiered approach directly addresses the high-stakes nature of new buildings by providing the best possible analysis at each stage, gracefully improving as more data becomes available, and managing stakeholder expectations by acknowledging the initial limitations of a purely data-driven approach.

**The Source of Confusion:**

*   In the "Multi-Building Dilemma" challenge, we concluded that a single global model was bad and the best solution was **Models per Building Archetype**.
*   In the "Cold Start Challenge," we concluded that after 6+ months, the best solution was **Individualized Models** (i.e., one model per building/apartment).

This seems like a contradiction. Here’s how they fit together in a single, coherent lifecycle.


### Clarified Hybrid Model Strategy (for both AD and EDF)

The system does not use just one strategy; it uses a **three-stage lifecycle for modeling**, where each building/apartment automatically "graduates" to the next stage as it accumulates enough data.

**Stage 1: Heuristics-Only (e.g., Age < 1 Month)**

*   **Model Used:** **No ML model.** Only the physics-informed rules engine is active.
*   **Applies to:** Brand new buildings with virtually no stable data.
*   **Rationale:** At this stage, any learned pattern is meaningless. We rely on deterministic, engineering-based rules to catch gross failures (e.g., "valve stuck open," "sensor reading is physically impossible"). This provides a basic safety net.

**Stage 2: Archetype Model (e.g., Age 1-6 Months)**

*   **Model Used:** **One model per Building Archetype.**
*   **Applies to:** Buildings with some data, but not enough to capture their unique seasonal patterns or long-term behavior reliably. This is the **primary cold-start solution**.
*   **Rationale:** The building's limited data is not used for *training*, but for *inference*. We use a robust model pre-trained on a large dataset from similar, older buildings (the "archetype"). This provides a reasonably accurate "prior belief" or "best guess" for how this new building *should* behave based on its type. It's vastly superior to a global model and the only viable ML approach when historical data is scant.

**Stage 3: Individualized Model (e.g., Age > 6 Months)**

*   **Model Used:** **One model per Building/Apartment.**
*   **Applies to:** Buildings with sufficient historical data (e.g., 6+ months, ideally including a full heating season).
*   **Rationale:** Once a building has enough of its own history, a model trained *specifically on its own data* will almost always be more accurate than a general archetype model. It can learn the unique thermal properties, specific solar gain profile, and the distinct rhythm of its residents. This is the mature, steady-state, and most accurate phase.

---

**How This Resolves the Contradiction:**

*   The conclusion of the **"Multi-Building Dilemma"** (use archetype models) is our primary strategy for **Stage 2 (the cold-start phase)**.
*   The conclusion of the **"Cold Start Challenge"** (use individualized models) is our strategy for **Stage 3 (the mature phase)**.

The overall strategy is **NOT** to choose just one of these forever, but to have an **automated system that graduates a building from Stage 1 to Stage 2 to Stage 3 over time.**

**Is this the same for both Anomaly Detection and Energy Demand Forecasting?**

**Yes, absolutely.** This three-stage lifecycle applies equally well to both use cases because both suffer from the exact same cold-start problem.

*   **AD Inference:** To detect an anomaly in a 3-month-old building, the inference pipeline would fetch the **"Archetype Model"** for that building's type from the Model Registry.
*   **EDF Inference:** To forecast demand for a 3-month-old building, the inference pipeline would fetch the **"Archetype Forecast Model"** for that building's type.
*   **AD/EDF Training:** The training pipelines are triggered differently. An **"Archetype Model"** is retrained periodically (e.g., monthly) using data from *all mature buildings within that archetype*. An **"Individualized Model"** is trained for a specific building only after it has accumulated enough data (e.g., the first training run is triggered at month 6).

**Implementation in the MLOps Pipeline:**

This strategy requires a key piece of logic in the **Inference Pipeline**, specifically in the model selection phase:

1.  **Input:** The inference workflow starts, knowing the `building_id`.
2.  **Metadata Lookup:** The first step is to query a metadata source (e.g., the Topology database) to get the `commissioning_date` and `archetype` for the given `building_id`.
3.  **Calculate Age:** `age = today - commissioning_date`.
4.  **Conditional Logic (Model Selection):**
    *   `if age < 1 month`: Route to a simple rules engine (or do nothing).
    *   `else if age >= 1 month AND age < 6 months`: The `GetApprovedModelPackage` Lambda is called with parameters to find the latest approved model for that specific **archetype**.
    *   `else (age >= 6 months)`: The `GetApprovedModelPackage` Lambda is called with parameters to find the latest approved model for that specific **`building_id`**. If no dedicated model exists yet (because its first training run hasn't completed), it falls back to the archetype model.

This provides a clear, consistent, and robust strategy that handles the entire lifecycle of a building from commissioning to maturity for both ML use cases. I hope this resolves the confusion

### Troubleshooting Guide

1.  **SFN Failures:** Check execution history for failed state, input/output, error message.
2.  **Job Failures (Processing/Training):** Check CloudWatch Logs for the specific job run. Look for Python errors, resource exhaustion, S3 access issues.
3.  **Lambda Failures:** Check CloudWatch Logs. Verify IAM permissions, input payload structure, environment variables, timeouts, memory limits. Check DLQ if configured.
4.  **Forecast Accuracy Issues:**
    *   Verify quality/availability of input weather forecasts.
    *   Check feature engineering logic for errors or skew vs. training.
    *   Analyze residuals from the model evaluation step.
    *   Check if model drift has occurred (compare recent performance to registry metrics). Trigger retraining if needed.
    *   Ensure correct model version was loaded by inference pipeline.
5.  **Data Loading Issues (Timestream/RDS):** Check `LoadForecastsToDB` Lambda logs for database connection errors, write throttling, data type mismatches, constraint violations. Check DB metrics.
6.  **API Serving Issues:** Check API Gateway logs and metrics. Check serving Lambda logs. Verify DB connectivity and query performance.

### Security Considerations

*   Apply IAM least privilege to all roles.
*   Encrypt data at rest (S3, Timestream/RDS, EBS) and in transit (TLS).
*   Use Secrets Manager for any API keys (e.g., weather provider).
*   Secure API Gateway endpoints (Authentication - Cognito/IAM/API Keys, Authorization, Throttling).
*   Perform regular vulnerability scans on the EDF container image.
*   Consider VPC deployment and endpoints for enhanced network security.

### Roadmap & Future Enhancements

*   Implement probabilistic forecasting (prediction intervals).
*   Incorporate more granular data (e.g., appliance recognition, improved occupancy detection) if available.
*   Explore more advanced forecasting models (LSTM, TFT) and benchmark rigorously.
*   Implement automated retraining triggers based on monitored forecast accuracy drift.
*   Develop more sophisticated XAI for forecasting (feature importance).
*   Add A/B testing framework for forecast models.
*   Integrate forecasts with building control systems (e.g., HVAC pre-cooling based on forecast).
