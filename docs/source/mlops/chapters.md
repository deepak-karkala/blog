- Top-K Items Selection, which organizes a set of items in a particular order that is suitable for user (e.g. search result).
- Classification, which assigns the input examples to one of the previously defined classes (e.g ‚Äúspam‚Äù/‚Äùnot spam‚Äù).
- Prediction, which assigns some most probable value to an entity of interest, such as stock value.
- Content Generation, to produce new content by learning from existing examples, such as finishing a Bach chorale cantata by learning from his former compositions.
- Question Answering, which answers an explicit question for example: ‚ÄúDoes this text describe this image?‚Äù
- Automation, which can be a set of user steps performed automatically, such as stock trading
- Fraud and Anomaly Detection, to identify an action or transaction being a fraud or suspicious
- Information Extraction and Annotation, to identify important information in a text, such as people‚Äôs names, job descriptions, companies, and locations.
