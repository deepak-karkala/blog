###### About Me

- After graduating in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [RV College of Engineering](https://www.rvce.edu.in/), I worked as a Junior Research Fellow at [Indian Institute of Science Bangalore](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/yalavarthy/MIG/index.html),  and worked on developing efficient algorithms for image reconstruction in Diffuse Optical Tomography.
- I then joined [Signalchip Innovations](https://www.signalchip.com/), a semiconductor startup in Bangalore, where I worked on signal processing algorithms for wireless communication (WCDMA, LTE).
- In 2018, I completed Masters from [EPFL Switzerland](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) with a focus on Machine Learning and Data Science. For my thesis project, I worked on data analytics and anomaly detection in IoT sensor data.
- I then worked remotely as a Data Engineer for eSMART Technologies, a Swiss company in home automation and building management.
