# state_dict

In PyTorch, the learnable parameters (i.e. weights and biases) of a torch.nn.Module model are contained in the model’s parameters (accessed with model.parameters()). A state_dict is simply a Python dictionary object that maps each layer to its parameter tensor. Because state_dict objects are Python dictionaries, they can be easily saved, updated, altered, and restored, adding a great deal of modularity to PyTorch models and optimizers.

1. layers with learnable parameters (convolutional layers, linear layers, etc.) and registered buffers (batchnorm’s running_mean) have entries in the model’s state_dict. 
2. Optimizer objects (torch.optim) also have a state_dict, which contains information about the optimizer’s state, as well as the hyperparameters used.
